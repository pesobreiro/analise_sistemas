## Resumo

Abstract

##    Introdução
Apresentação UML
>    "UML is the blueprint of a software system. It is a standard language to specify, visualize, and model the artefacts of a software system. It provides the ability to capture the characteristics of a system by using notations." (Chung and Pak 2006:61)

>    "The origin of UML is archaeological and comprehensive. Three software-engineering gurus contributed significantly: Grady Booch, Ivan Jacobson, and Jim Rumbaugh. Booch was strong in system design, but he neglected analysis (Booch 1994, Booch et al. 1999). Rumbaugh was strong in system analysis, but he put little emphasis on design stage. Jacobson et al. (1999) emphasized user experience. Their early works together established the base for UML in 1990s." (Chung and Pak 2006:61)

>    "The underlying premise of UML is that no one diagram can capture the different elements of a system in its entirety. Hence, UML is made up of eight diagrams that can be used to model a system at different points of time in the software life cycle of a system" (Chung and Pak 2006:61)

>    "Use case diagram: a collection of system functions, showing which actors and processes interact with each use case." (Chung and Pak 2006:61)

>    "Class diagram: shows the classes in a system and variety of relationships (association, aggregation, and inheritance) among classes" (Chung and Pak 2006:62)

>    "State diagram: shows the event-ordered behaviour of an object." (Chung and Pak 2006:62)

>    "Activity diagram: emphasizes the flow of control among objects and models the functions of a system." (Chung and Pak 2006:62)

>    "Sequence diagram: displays object interactions and messages in time-sequence order." (Chung and Pak 2006:62)

>    "Collaboration diagram: displays object interactions in event-sequence order under a relatively complicated circumstance." (Chung and Pak 2006:62)

>    "Component diagram: shows physical components, interfaces, and usage dependency between components." (Chung and Pak 2006:62)

>    "Deployment diagram: shows how physical components are distributed across the physical environment in which the system runs." (Chung and Pak 2006:62)

Exemplos

> "By writing up a case-study report, the real-life context can be described. A case study is also appropriate for explanatory reasons to answer research questions about the 'How' and the 'Why'. In particular, it addresses (1) why a set of decisions were taken, (2) how they were implemented, and (3) what the result was. Hence, we would follow the case-study protocol to validate our theory applied on the adopting organization. The quality of our research design could be judged by the validity and reliability." (Chung and Pak 2006:62)

> "The proposal of our research is 'The UML approach is useful for developing KBS in a small financial company" (Chung and Pak 2006:62)

> "Yin (1989)" (Chung and Pak 2006:62)

> "stated that single-case design is justifiable, provided the case is a rare event. As UML is rarely used under this context, a single-case study would be of added value." (Chung and Pak 2006:62)

> "To maintain the internal validity, the credibility on the causal relationship was established in this research. In fact, one of the analytic tactics, so-called explanation building, was used in this case study. This advocates iteratively monitoring the causal relationship between the intervention and the research proposition." (Chung and Pak 2006:62)

> "To keep the external validity, the findings were generalized beyond this single case study. This was achieved by replication of the theory in other areas. Tactically, the approach was synthesized in the form of lecture notes and group exercises so that students could understand and replicate the theory. The students' answer should be documented to support further research. In addition, to uphold the reliability, the company background and details of the UML adoption were articulated clearly through the case study" (Chung and Pak 2006:62)
